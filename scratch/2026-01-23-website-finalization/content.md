## TAGLINE

**Current:**
> "Build robots that learn. Understand intelligence along the way." — me

**New (leave blank to keep):**
> I want to write something in the idea of : I explore the world through buildings, looking into different perspectives as physicas, biological inspired intellgegcne phenomenon and put taht into the AI building thorugh langaues in mathenaticsna nd statsitiscs and programming langauges. Can you find some very good phrase like that?

## PROJECT 1: Disentangled Scale Control

**Current Description:**
> Developing compact, interpretable latent representations for fine-grained robotic manipulation. Learning parameterizations where a small number of latent dimensions can continuously control policy scales (e.g., door-opening angle, motion speed) while preserving smoothness and interpretability.

**New Description:**
>

## PROJECT 2: Meta-Adaptive Latent Planning (MALP)

**Current Description:**
> Improving multi-task performance of Latent Plan Transformers by integrating Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Enabling agents to generalize across manipulation tasks while producing stable, continuous control through learned strategy latents.

**New Description:**
>

## PROJECT 4: Mori-Zwanzig Formalism

**Current Description:**
> Applied Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism to separate neural dynamics into resolved and unresolved states. Achieved major MSE reduction on neural data (awake state: 3.140 → 0.101) compared to baseline DMD.

**New Description:**
